# Simple Interest Calculator

## Project Description
This repository contains a Bash script that calculates simple interest based on user input. The simple interest calculator computes interest using the standard formula and provides both the interest amount and total amount.

## Features
- Interactive command-line interface
- Calculates simple interest using formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- Accepts user input for principal, rate, and time
- Displays detailed calculation results
- Handles decimal values for accurate calculations

## Formula
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script: `./simple-interest.sh`
4. Enter the required values when prompted

## Input Parameters
- **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money
- **Rate of Interest (R)**: Annual interest rate in percentage
- **Time Period (T)**: Duration in years

## Example Calculation
If Principal = 1000, Rate = 5%, Time = 2 years:
Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
Total Amount = 1000 + 100 = 1100
